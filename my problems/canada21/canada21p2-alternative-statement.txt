Darcy is a grade 9 student at Pierre Elliott Trudeau High School. He will probably get the infamous Turing assignment from his computer science class in grade 10.

In the infamous Turing assignment, you have to pick a random comic strip from the Internet and replicate the image as closely as possible in the Turing language. However, there is a loophole that Darcy can use to his advantage.

The `drawdot` command changes the colour of a single pixel in the output screen. This command needs the ~x~ coordinate, ~y~ coordinate, and the colour ID, respectively. These three variables are integers. If a point at ~(1,3)~ needs to have the colour ID ~6~, the command `drawdot (1, 3, 6);` should be used. **The spaces must be included since proper indentation is important**.

Colours in Turing are handled in this way:

 - There are ~N~ default colours, and each colour has an ID between ~0~ to ~N-1~ (inclusive).
 - Each default colour is defined by the triplet ~(a,b,c)~. Each number in the triplet is an integer from ~0~ to ~255~.
 - The distance from the colour ~(A,B,C)~ to the colour ~(a,b,c)~ is ~|A-a| + |B-b| + |C-c|~. (Note: ~|x|~ is the absolute value of ~x~, which is the *positive* distance between ~x~ and ~0~)

When using the `drawdot` command, it is important to match the colours as closely as possible! If there are two equally close colours, the colour with the lower ID should be used.

Darcy has chosen a comic with dimensions ~X~ and ~Y~. Can you generate a Turing program that will draw the comic?

##Constraints

~1 \le N \le 256~

~1 \le X \le 480~

~1 \le Y \le 360~

All ~x~ coordinates satisfy ~0 \le x < X~. All ~y~ coordinates satisfy ~0 \le y < Y~.

In every colour triplet, each number is an integer in the range ~0~ to ~255~ (inclusive).

##Input Specification

The first line of input will contain the integer ~N~.

On the next ~N~ lines, the ~i^{th}~ line will contain ~a_{i-1}~, ~b_{i-1}~, and ~c_{i-1}~, which is the triplet for the default colour with ID ~i-1~.

The next line contains ~X~ and ~Y~, the dimensions of the comic that Darcy has chosen.

The next ~X \times Y~ lines will contain ~5~ integers. The first ~2~ integers are the ~x~ and ~y~ coordinates of the pixel, respectively. The last ~3~ integers form a triplet ~(A,B,C)~, which is the colour of the pixel in the comic.

##Output Specification

Output ~X \times Y~ lines, the commands in a Turing program that will replicate the comic as closely as possible. Each command should be on a new line. The commands can be given in any order. **Remember to print the commands in the proper format**.
